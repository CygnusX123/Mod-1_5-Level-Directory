This Directory is called Where_Im_Going

I worked at some of the top companies in CT during a 25 year working 
career.  I took sometime off to care for my ailing parents.  My dad had 
dementia and terminal cancer and my mom had Alheimer's.  Both have 
recently passed.  I am now trying to focus on myself and my skillset in 
order to find a job.  My skills had become seriously out of date.
